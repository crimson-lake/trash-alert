# Type 200-190
## Idea
Application is inspired by [*Uwaga Å›mieciarka jedzie*](https://www.facebook.com/UwagaSmieciarkaJedzie) - a community of people interested in so-called dumpster diving (picking useful treasures from other people's trash).
Dumpster diving is getting trendy among young people - some of them want to live with zero-waste philosophy, and some are just looking for classics of modern design ([like this Chierowski 366 armchair to die for](https://www.homebook.pl/artykuly/3952/fotel-chierowskiego-366-najslynniejszy-fotel-prl-u)) to spice up home decor. 

The app allows users to publish alerts about interesting items left by trash containers or post about things they want to give away. 
All alerts are displayed on the map, which makes it easier to look for treasures and plan dumpster hunt in the neighborhood.
